# 🐝 BUZZ-Bee: The Ultimate Buzzword Detector!
“Synergy,” “Innovation,” “Disrupt”... Are you drowning in corporate buzzwords? 🏊‍♂️🔊
Buzz-Bee scans webpages and reveals just how "BUZZED" they really are!

## 📢 What Does BUZZ-Bee Do?
✅ Detects buzzwords on any webpage <br>
✅ Calculates buzzword density 📊<br>
✅ Displays a fun & interactive doughnut chart 🍩<br>
✅ Ranks the page with a "Buzz-Level" (Green = Clear, Red = Overloaded!)<br>
✅ Shows the most-used buzzword category 🎯<br>

## 🎬 How It Works
- Install BUZZ-Bee from the Chrome Extensions page
- Click the 🐝 BUZZ-Bee icon in your toolbar
- Watch as the Buzz-Level & Chart update in real time!

## 🎨 How the Magic Happens
🟢 Green (0-5%) → Chil Buzz 🐝 (The Site passed the vibe check)<br>
🟡 Yellow (5-15%) → Moderately Buzzed 🧐 (Some Jargon, but Manageable!)<br>
🟠 Orange (15-30%) → Shady Buzzed 🔍(Oh No! It's getting worse!!1!)<br>
🔴 Red (30%+) → Overloaded 🚨 (Run! It’s a Buzzword Nightmare!)<br>

## The Formula
BUZZ Percentage = 5*#_Buzzwords / #_total_words <br>
=> The times five is a personal impression, where it accurately represents the ✨vibe✨ of the webpage.
